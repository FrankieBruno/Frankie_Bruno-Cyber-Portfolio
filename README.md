## 🎯 Objective

My journey in technology has inspired a deep passion for cybersecurity, and I am eager to bring my skills to a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I thrive on helping organizations detect, respond to, and prevent threats in today’s constantly evolving digital landscape. Looking ahead, my long term goal is to advance into penetration testing, where I can proactively identify vulnerabilities and strengthen security from the ground up.

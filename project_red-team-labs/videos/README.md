### üîç Black Sentinel Demo Video
**File:** `Black Sentinel Demo Video [Hunter M. & Frankie B.].mp4`
**Authors:** Hunter McShan & Frankie Bruno
**Duration:** ~5:30 minutes
**Description:** Complete demonstration of the Black Sentinel framework showcasing a full attack chain from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and SIEM analysis

**What's Covered:**
- **Network Discovery:** SentinelScan.py automated scanning with Nmap integration
- **Target Identification:** Windows machine with Apache web server detection
- **Web Enumeration:** HNF Tactical website exploration and GoBuster directory discovery
- **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Command injection via diagnostics.php page
- **Payload Delivery:** Reverse TCP shell generation and deployment
- **Data Exfiltration:** CSV file extraction from victim machine
- **SIEM Analysis:** Splunk data visualization and threat intelligence

**Attack Chain Timeline:**
- **[0:00-0:30]** Hunter introduces SentinelScan.py and demonstrates network scanning
- **[0:30-1:03]** Target identification and HNF Tactical website exploration
- **[1:03-1:29]** GoBuster directory enumeration and diagnostics.php discovery
- **[1:29-2:19]** Command injection setup and reverse shell payload generation
- **[2:19-2:44]** Payload delivery and execution via Python server and Netcat
- **[2:44-3:46]** Frankie takes over, demonstrates reverse shell access and data discovery
- **[3:46-5:23]** Data exfiltration to Kali Linux and Splunk SIEM analysis with visualizations
